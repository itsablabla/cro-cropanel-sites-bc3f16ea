# One-time costs appear separately — dev spec
Site: nomadinternet.com · Priority 6 · Medium · Effort: Medium (2-5 days)

## Problem
One-time charges are listed separately from monthly prices, causing visitors to overlook them until later.

## Evidence (from the live site)
> A section heading reads “$0.00 (one-time)”.
> A section heading reads “$99.99 (one-time)”.
> Prices shown on the page: $99.95 /month $129.95 /month $99.95/mo $0.00 $99.95 $99.99

## Current state
notes: One-time costs separate from monthly.

## Required change
notes: Combine into single price summary line per plan.

## Acceptance criteria

- WHEN the change is live
- THEN Combine into single price summary line per plan.
- AND no layout regression at 375px / 768px / 1280px
