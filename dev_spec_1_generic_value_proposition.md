# Value proposition is generic — dev spec
Site: nomadinternet.com · Priority 1 · High · Effort: Low (0.5-2 days)

## Problem
The hero headline promises reliability but fails to explain what the product is or why it's better, lacking visitor-centric benefit.

## Evidence (from the live site)
> Reliable Internet That Works Anywhere in the U.S.
> Internet That Just Works

## Current state
h1: Reliable Internet That Works Anywhere in the U.S.; notes: Generic value prop.

## Required change
h1: Wireless Home Internet for Rural and On-the-Go; notes: Lead with concrete benefit like unlimited data or no contracts.

## Acceptance criteria
- GIVEN a first-time visitor on the affected page
- WHEN the change is live
- THEN Lead with concrete benefit like unlimited data or no contracts.
- AND no layout regression at 375px / 768px / 1280px
- AND the changed control is keyboard-reachable with an accessible name

## Tracking
- Fire `cro_generic_value_proposition` on interaction with the changed element
- Verify the event fires in BOTH variants before opening traffic

## Test plan
- Two-proportion z-test, 95% significance, 80% power
- 315,206 visitors per variant to detect a 5.0% relative lift
- Run at least one full business cycle; duration depends on traffic

## Rollback
Feature-flag the change; revert if the primary metric drops for 3 consecutive days.
